Getting rich can provide us with the financial security and freedom to pursue our passions and make a positive impact on the world. 
We can use our wealth to support causes we care about, help those in need, and create opportunities for others.
 We can also use our wealth to invest in ourselves and our education, and to create a lasting legacy.
